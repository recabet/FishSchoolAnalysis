Performance Metrics (↑ = higher is better, ↓ = lower is better):
         Silhouette Score (↑)  Calinski-Harabasz Score (↑)  Davies-Bouldin Score (↓)  Stability Score (↑)
kmeans               0.151377                   405.359495                  4.231659             0.998934
dbscan                    NaN                          NaN                       NaN             1.000000

Best Method Per Metric:
- Best Silhouette Score: kmeans (0.1514)
- Best Calinski-Harabasz Score: kmeans (405.3595)
- Best Davies-Bouldin Score: kmeans (4.2317)
- Best Stability Score: dbscan (1.0000)

Overall recommended clustering method: KMEANS

Recommendation rationale:
The KMEANS method provides best separation between clusters, best ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster variance, lowest average similarity between clusters.

Cluster Distribution Summary:
- KMEANS: 2 clusters, no outliers
- DBSCAN: 1 clusters, 108 outliers (1.0%)
- HDBSCAN: 0 clusters, 10995 outliers (100.0%)
